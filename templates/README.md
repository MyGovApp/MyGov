# Templates

There are a collection of file templates here to assist with consistent development for this repository. Right now they are just a collection of atom snippets. Eventually I would like to create a cli tool to further automate the process. Much like ember.

To use the atom snippets copy the code in the myGovTemplates.cson file into your snippets.cson file. This can be found by going to `Atom » Snippets...` probably `File » Snippets...` on Windows.

Currently the keyword to invoke the template snippets is `nerp` standing for the stack that the app is built on; Node, Express, React, Postgres.
